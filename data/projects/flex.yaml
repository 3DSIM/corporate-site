description: AM practitioners spend tens of millions of dollars every year generating the experimental data needed to develop process understanding for part qualification. 3DSIMâ€™s FLEX product dramatically reduces the need for metal laser sintering experimentation by providing a rapid, cloud-based simulation solution that allows users to simulate designed experiments, test new theories and optimize process parameters based upon a given set of material, machine and geometry assumptions. FLEX allows users to rapidly simulate multiple combinations of inputs to analyze their effects on outputs such as thermal history, phase transformations, residual stress, porosity, meltpool characteristics, surface roughness, part distortion, and crystal structure.
