title = "What is it?"
text = """<strong>exaSIM&#x2122; Software</strong> is a cloud-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) simulation tool that provides metal laser
sintering users with rapid insight into residual stress and distortion predictions. These predictions are used to
accelerate production through informed support generation and trend analysis; reducing trial and error
iterations for successful builds. exaSIM is available in <strong>GovCloud</strong> for our customers who want access within an
ITAR compliant environment. The AWS GovCloud (US) is ITAR, FedRAMP and DOD SRG compliant and is ISO
9001 / 27001 / 27017 / 27018 certified."""

title = "How does it work?"
text = """exaSIM&#x2122; utilizes advanced computational solvers to predict residual stress and distortion in a layer-by-layer
fashion. A user supplied STL file is automatically meshed for analysis. A strain pattern is calculated and used to
simulate how residual stress and distortion evolve as the part is being built. The maximum stress components
are stored and used for support generation. Upon completion, exaSIM users are provided with stress contours
for their part, multiple support options and distortion before and after removal from supports.

exaSIM&#x2122; offers three operational modes for predicting distortion and residual stress: 1) Uniform Assumed
Strain, 2) Scan Pattern Based Strain, and 3) Thermal Strain. Uniform Assumed Strain provides the fastest
approximation by utilizing a uniform isotropic strain assumption. Scan Pattern Based Strain offers a higher
fidelity solution by taking into account scan pattern based anisotropy. Thermal strain provides the highest
degree of accuracy by predicting how thermal cycling affects strain accumulation. All modes can be used to
generate supports and conduct trend analyses using linear elasticity or non-linear plasticity."""

title = "Support Generation"
text = """exaSIM&#x2122; provides three types of support structures. Thin wall supports are single-scan-width walls that are
distributed beneath each downward-facing surface below a user-specified angle. Uniform supports are placed
based upon geometric considerations only. Stress-based thin wall supports are distributed such that more
walls are placed in regions of higher residual stress and fewer walls in regions of lower residual stress. Thick
wall supports are uniformly spaced supports where the thickness of walls are increased in regions of higher
residual stress. Each of these support types can be output as STL files for any exaSIM simulation."""

title = "Trend Analysis"
text = """exaSIM&#x2122; users can select successful part orientations and support strategies by visualizing the effects
of their assumptions on distortion and residual stress of as-built parts. Stress and distortion values are delivered to
the user using the open source Visualization ToolKit (VTK) file format.  These files can be viewed in many 3rd party
visualization tools, including Paraview, a free viewer.  VTK files enable users to see the differences between the
original undeformed geometry and the final deformed geometry.  Color maps can also be used for viewing
distortion trends, final residual stress, and the maximum stress components throughout the build.
These visualizations enable users to select the orientation and strategy which best meets their part design intent.
By reducing maximum part stresses and distortion, users can reduce their likelihood for blade crash failures."""
