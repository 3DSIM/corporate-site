title = "What is it?"
text = """<strong>exaSIM&#x2122; Software</strong> ™ is a suite of metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) simulation tools that provide critical insight into the
complex physics-based phenomena associated with laser powder bed fusion. exaSIM generates practical
solutionsto residual stress, distortion and build failure, enabling users to achieve part tolerances and avoid build
failures without trial and error experimentation. STL files can be automatically distortion compensated to
counteract the distortion that occurs during part production. Two types of support structures are automatically
generated based upon residual stress predictions, enabling exaSIM users to avoid wasting time and material
when placing supports. Build failure can be avoided by utilizing the automatically generated supports and the
Blade Crash detection feature. For ease of use, greater speed, data storage, and rapid feature implementation,
exaSIM runs in a secure cloud environment. exaSIM is available in GovCloud for our customers who want access
within an ITAR, FedRAMP and DOD SRG compliant and ISO 9001 / 27001 / 27017 / 27018 certified environment."""

title = "How does it work?"
text = """exaSIM&#x2122; utilizes patent-pending computational solvers to predict residual stress and distortion in a layer-bylayer
fashion. A user supplied STL file or machine build file is automatically meshed for analysis. A strain
pattern is calculated using either: 1) Uniform Assumed Strain, 2) Scan Pattern Strain, or 3) Thermal Strain.
Uniform Assumed Strain provides the fastest approximation by utilizing a uniform isotropic strain assumption.
Scan Pattern Based Strain offers a higher fidelity solution by considering local scan pattern orientation to
predict anisotropic shrinkage. Thermal strain, a simulation mode unique to 3DSIM, provides the highest
degree of accuracy. Thermal strain is based upon a full-part thermal analysis, scan vector-by-scan vector.
Local strain magnitude is calculated based upon the number of times a location goes through elevated thermal
cycling without re-melting. Scan orientation is utilized within thermal strain to correctly predict anisotropic
effects. All exaSIM modes can be used to output supports, create visualizations, conduct trend analyses,
predict build failure mechanisms and provide distortion compensated STL files. exaSIM offers both linear
elasticity and non-linear plasticity assumptions."""

title = "Support Generation"
text = """The maximum residual stresses that supports must
withstand are predicted using 3DSIM’s Mechanics Solver
and passed to the support generation module. Support
structures are automatically generated based upon an
algorithm which varies the support density to carry these
maximum residual stresses. The resulting support structure
is provided to the user, in an STL file format.  exaSIM&#x2122; provides three types of support structures. Thin wall supports are single-scan-width walls that are
distributed beneath each downward-facing surface below a user-specified angle. Uniform supports are placed
based upon geometric considerations only. Stress-based thin wall supports are distributed such that more
walls are placed in regions of higher residual stress and fewer walls in regions of lower residual stress. Thick
wall supports are uniformly spaced supports where the thickness of walls increase in regions of higher residual
stress. Each of these support types can be output as STL files for any exaSIM simulation. """

title = "Trend Analysis"
text = """exaSIM&#x2122; users can select successful part orientations and support strategies by visualizing the effects of their
assumptions on distortion and residual stress for as-built parts. Stress, distortion, blade crash potential and
high strain regions are output in the VTK file format. These files (including layer-by-layer VTK files) can be
viewed in many 3rd party visualization tools, including Paraview, a free viewer. VTK files enable users to see
the differences between the original un-deformed geometry and the final deformed geometry before and
after removal from supports. Color maps can also be used for viewing distortion trends, final residual stress,
maximum stress components throughout the build, high strain regions and potential blade crash location.
These visualizations enable users to select the orientation and strategy which best meets their part design
intent. By reducing maximum part stresses and distortion, users can reduce their likelihood for build failures."""
